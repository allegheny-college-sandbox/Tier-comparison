Project 2 CMPSC 203

This project consists on an enhancement for SheetsShuttle and Gatorgrade. 

## Description of the project:

In this project, We are creating different tiers for different grades within sheetshuttle. We will create various code segments within the sheetshuttle program to determine what tiers those students are recieving. This will also determine what the student(s) will need to work to improve for their next projects and for there future development withing computer science.
